Final project for Intro to NLP. This system simplifies exploring Amazon reviews by enabling queries like “battery life: excellent.” It retrieves reviews using three methods: Boolean search, enhanced search with embeddings and sentiment analysis, and a semantic filter combining embeddings, bigram analysis, and sentiment alignment.
